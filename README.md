House Price Prediction

This repository contains a project that predicts house prices using linear regression. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, validate its assumptions, and evaluate its performance. The dataset includes various attributes of houses, such as size, location, and number of rooms.


Introduction

In this project, we aim to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset used includes several attributes of houses, such as size, location, number of rooms, etc. The goal is to preprocess the data, train a linear regression model, validate its assumptions, and evaluate its performance.


Installation:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git

cd house-price-prediction

pip install -r requirements.txt


Data Description:


Dataset --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

Price-> The target variable representing the price of the house.


Results:

The linear regression model was trained on the processed data, and its performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The analysis showed that certain features, such as location, size, and number of rooms, significantly influence house prices.


Conclusion

This project provided insights into the factors affecting house prices and demonstrated the effectiveness of linear regression in predictive analytics. By preprocessing the data, applying linear regression, and validating the assumptions, we achieved predictions.
